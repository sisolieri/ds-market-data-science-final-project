# DS Market - Final Project

This repository contains the final project for my Master's program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. The project was structured as a roleplay where my team and I acted as data scientists at **DS Market**, a large retail chain in the USA. Our main task was to help the company become data-driven by achieving three key objectives.

## Project Overview

1. **Business Intelligence**:  
   We created an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to analyze the companyâ€™s current situation, focusing on key business metrics like revenue, sales, and product performance. [View the screenshots of the dashboard here](./business_intelligence/README.md).

2. **Clustering Analysis**:  
   We performed **KMeans clustering** on both **products** and **stores** to group similar items and locations. This helped DS Market to optimize marketing campaigns and product placement based on customer behaviors and sales trends.
   - **Product Clusters**:
     - 5 Segments: Top Sellers, Low Price, High Price, Event Loss, Event Boosted.
     - Performance and price variations were analyzed to identify the most and least successful product groups.
   - **Store Clusters**:
     - 3 Segments: Consolidated, Emerging, Lagging.
     - Regional and global market share, along with sales growth, were used to cluster stores.

3. **Sales Forecasting**:  
   We built a **multivariate machine learning model using XGBoost** to forecast sales at a product-store level. Given the time constraints, we opted for a functional model suitable for a pilot test, ensuring that the model was capable of generating reliable week-by-week predictions. A common issue in such projects is focusing too much on creating a model that performs well for the first week but fails significantly for weeks 2, 3, and 4, leading to inaccurate and inconsistent forecasts. 

   Our approach aimed at keeping the model relatively simple yet robust, ensuring it could generate consistent predictions even beyond the first week. This was a key focus of our work.  
   
   **Future improvements** could involve increasing the model's complexity and the number of features, as well as exploring and comparing alternative models to identify the best-performing one.

   - **Key Findings**:
     - The model globally had an error between **7 and 10 units**, depending on the prediction horizon (with one-week forecasts being more accurate than those for 2, 3, or 4 weeks).
     - The **Supermarket** category had the highest RMSE, with average values between **15 and 20** units.
     - The categories **Home & Garden** and **Accessories** showed much lower RMSEs, around **1 and 4** units.
   
   The forecast results were used to evaluate the stock remaining in stores and identify lost sales opportunities due to under-stocking.


## Key Results

- **11.73% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)** from January 2011 to April 2016.
- Clustering analysis revealed **16% of products as top sellers**, while **23% of stores were lagging** in performance.
- The forecasting models provided valuable insights into demand patterns, allowing for more effective stock and order planning.
