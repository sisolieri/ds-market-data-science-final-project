# DS Market - Data Science Final Project

This repository contains the final project for my Master's program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. In this project, my team and I assumed the role of data scientists at **DS Market**, a large retail chain in the USA that decided to become a data-driven company. The project had three main objectives:

## Project Objectives

1. **Business Intelligence**:
   - We created an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** to analyze the company's current situation from various perspectives (sales, customer demographics, inventory).
   - The dashboard helped the company's decision-makers visualize key business metrics.

2. **Clustering Analysis**:
   - Using machine learning techniques, we performed clustering on both **products** and **stores** to identify similar groups. 
   - These clusters were used to inform marketing strategies and operational decisions.

3. **Sales Forecasting**:
   - We built models to **forecast product-store level sales** for the next four weeks, helping the company plan inventory orders from suppliers.
   - Various forecasting models were tested, including time series models (ARIMA, Prophet) and machine learning models (XGBoost, Random Forest).

## Repository Structure

- **/business_intelligence/**: Contains the Power BI file and screenshots of the dashboard.
- **/clustering/**: Contains the code and notebooks for the clustering analysis.
- **/forecasting/**: Contains the forecasting models and results.
- **/docs/**: Includes the final project report with a detailed explanation of the entire project.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**: For data manipulation and clustering.
- **Power BI**: For business intelligence and dashboarding.
- **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, **XGBoost**: For sales forecasting.
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
